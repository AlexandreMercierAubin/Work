In the textile industry, the looms are now automatic, but
what is left to be automated is the scheduling process. This paper is
about the scheduling of the looms and workers doing the setup between
two jobs. We explain the problem, tools, methodologies, and constraints
to solve this NP-Hard problem. As of now, this is a work in progress.
