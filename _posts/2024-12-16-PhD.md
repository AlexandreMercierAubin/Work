Really just a big passion project of mine.

**Abstract:** We present methods for the efficient simulation of various types of deformable bodies by
using non‑deformation as a measure for model reduction. Our algorithm identifies nondeforming
elements as those with low strain rates over multiple frames. We use adaptive
rigidification as a tool to create approximation methods for the simulation of deformable
bodies. We first use the method in the context of soft bodies, yielding simulations often
orders of magnitude faster than the elastic simulations. Moreover, we present an oracle
that allows rigidified elements to become elastic again as needed. Then, we adapt our
method to thin shell models and tackle their respective challenges. Namely, we present
how to handle rigidifying bending elements and an edge filter to improve the elastification
oracle on contacts that cause bending deformation. Additionally, we measure the impact
of numerical scaling on the conditioning of our system. We also present a fundamentally
different view of rigidification, where we generate a sequence of resolutions with rigid
patterns for an iterative multi‑layer method in constraint‑based approaches. In this last
contribution, we aim to find the ground truth solution through a fast solver, rather than
only generating visually consistent simulations. We demonstrate our results on various
examples in 2D or 3D. We also dive into the implementation of the algorithms.

# Note
You can find most of its content in individual papers. 
I would prefer if you cite the papers directly, but whatever suits you best.
This is slightly annoying that it says 2025 when it was done by 2024, but whatever.
I hope you enjoy how the projects that I researched seamlessly blend in one big cohesive block of text.
